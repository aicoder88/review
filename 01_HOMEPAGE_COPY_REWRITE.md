# PROMPT 1: Homepage Copy Rewrite - Alex Hormozi Style

## Objective
Rewrite ALL copy on the ReviewCatLitter.com homepage using Alex Hormozi's direct, value-driven, pain-agitating copywriting style. Keep the existing beautiful design - ONLY change the words. The #1 reason for this site to exist is to drive qualified, pre-warmed traffic to purrify.ca, so that should be mentioned subtly across the site strategically, not obviously.

## Background: Who is Alex Hormozi?
Alex Hormozi is a $100M entrepreneur known for brutally honest, no-BS marketing that:
- Leads with specific pain points, not vague benefits
- Uses exact numbers instead of "many" or "lots"
- Agitates problems before presenting solutions
- Demonstrates clear value equations ("we spent X so you save Y")
- Builds trust through transparency and specificity
- Makes bold claims backed by proof
- Speaks directly to the reader's frustration

## Target Audience Pain Points
Cat owners who are:
- ✅ Tired of litter tracking throughout their house
- ✅ Frustrated with dust clouds when pouring/scooping
- ✅ Sick of litter that doesn't actually clump (just turns to cement)
- ✅ Annoyed by constant odor despite "odor control" claims
- ✅ Confused by 50+ brands all claiming to be "the best"
- ✅ Wasting money trying different litters that disappoint
- ✅ Spending too much time scooping ineffective litter

## Brand Voice Guidelines

### DO:
- ✅ Be direct and conversational ("Look, here's the truth...")
- ✅ Use specific numbers ("We spent $47,000 testing 547 products")
- ✅ Agitate pain points ("You've wasted $500+ on litters that promised zero dust...")
- ✅ Show the value equation ("We tested for 6 months so you save 20 hours of research")
- ✅ Use "we" and "you" language (direct connection)
- ✅ Call out industry BS ("Brands charge 3x more for 'premium' that's the same as basic")
- ✅ Make bold claims with proof ("This litter reduced tracking by 73% in our tests")

### DON'T:
- ❌ Use corporate speak ("premier solutions for discerning consumers")
- ❌ Be vague ("many products", "highly rated", "quality reviews")
- ❌ Sound like marketing ("experience the difference", "discover excellence")
- ❌ Use clichés ("your cat deserves the best", "purrfect choice")
- ❌ Be overly formal or academic
- ❌ Oversell without proof ("amazing", "incredible", "the best ever")

## Copywriting Examples

### Hero Headline Options (Pick the strongest):
1. "We Spent $47,000 Testing Every Major Cat Litter Brand. Here's What Actually Works."
2. "Stop Wasting Money on Cat Litter That Doesn't Work"
3. "The Truth About Cat Litter (That Pet Stores Won't Tell You)"
4. "We Bought 547 Cat Litters So You Don't Have To"

### Hero Subheadline:
**WRONG:** "Data-driven reviews for discerning cat parents"
**RIGHT:** "Stop buying dusty, tracking, barely-clumping litter based on marketing hype. We spent 6 months and $47K testing every major brand. Get the real data, not the BS."

### Trust Bar Stats (Specific Numbers):
- "$47,000+ Spent on Testing" (not "500+ products tested")
- "2,847 Hours of Lab Testing" (not "rigorous testing")
- "12,847 Cat Owners Trust Our Reviews" (specific number, not "50K+")
- "Zero Sponsored Reviews" (clear value prop)

### Section Headlines:

**Featured Winners:**
- WRONG: "Top Rated Cat Litters"
- RIGHT: "Winners That Actually Earn Their Price Tag"

**Methodology:**
- WRONG: "How We Test Cat Litter"
- RIGHT: "How We Actually Test (Unlike Other 'Review' Sites)"

**Latest Reviews:**
- WRONG: "Recent Reviews"
- RIGHT: "Recently Tested (So You Get Current Data)"

**Categories:**
- WRONG: "Browse Categories"
- RIGHT: "Find What Actually Works for Your Situation"

### Call-to-Action Buttons:

**Primary CTAs:**
- "See What Actually Works" (not "View Review")
- "Get The Real Data" (not "Learn More")
- "Find Your Winner" (not "Browse Products")
- "Read The Full Test Results" (not "Full Review")

**Secondary CTAs:**
- "Stop Wasting Money on Bad Litter" (not "Subscribe")
- "Get Our Free Buyer's Guide" (not "Newsletter Signup")

### Body Copy Examples:

**About Our Testing (Methodology Section):**
```
Most "review" sites test litter for 3-5 days. Maybe a week if you're lucky.

We test for 90 days. Minimum.

Why? Because clumping might seem great on day 3, but by day 30 you realize it's turned your litter box into concrete. Or that "99% dust-free" litter filled your lungs on the first pour.

Here's our actual process:
→ We buy every product with our own money (zero sponsorships)
→ 23 different lab tests per product (dust levels, clumping strength, odor absorption - measured with actual equipment)
→ 90-day home trials with 10 different cat households
→ That's 900 days of real-world testing per product

Other sites get free samples and post a review in 48 hours. We spend $400+ per product testing it properly. That's the difference between a commercial and the truth.
```

**Featured Winners Section:**
```
We tested 547 cat litters over 6 months. These are the only 4 worth buying.

Not "pretty good" or "decent for the price." These are legitimately elite products that earned their spot through actual performance, not marketing budgets.

Here's what makes each one worth your money:
```

**Value Proposition (New Section to Add):**
```
What This Costs Us vs What It Saves You

We Spent:
• $47,000 buying 547 products at retail price
• $23,000 on lab testing equipment
• 2,847 hours testing and analyzing

You Save:
• 20+ hours of confused research
• $340/year on average (by choosing the right litter from day 1)
• Countless hours dealing with dust, tracking, and odor from bad litter

We eat the cost. You get the truth. That's the deal.
```
