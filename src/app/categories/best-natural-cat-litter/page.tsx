        <h3>Why Switch to Natural Litter?</h3>
        <p>
            Clay litter is strip-mined and ends up in landfills forever. Natural litters (corn, wheat, pine, walnut) are sustainable, often flushable, and lighter.
        </p>

        <h3>The Hidden Problem with Natural Litters</h3>
        <p>
            Natural litters have one major weakness: <strong>Odor Control</strong>. Because they are made of organic material (food, basically), they can start to ferment when mixed with urine, creating a distinct "barnyard" or sour smell.
        </p>

            <h4 className="font-bold text-green-900 mb-2">💡 The Natural Litter Cheat Code</h4>
            <p className="text-green-800 mb-4">
                You don't have to choose between saving the planet and having a fresh house.
            </p>
            <p className="text-green-800">
                <strong>The Solution:</strong> Add a probiotic booster like <a href="https://purrify.ca" target="_blank" className="font-bold underline hover:text-green-950">Purrify</a> to your natural litter.
            </p>
            <p className="font-bold text-green-900 mt-2">
                Purrify uses enzymes to break down the waste <em>before</em> it ferments into that sour smell. It makes corn and wheat litter perform just as well as heavy chemical clay.

        <h3>Corn vs. Wood vs. Grass</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Corn (World's Best):</strong> Clumps the best. Can smell sour.<br />
            <strong>Wood (Okocat):</strong> Smells like lumber (nice). Clumps poorly.<br />
            <strong>Grass (SmartCat):</strong> Clumps amazing. Tracks everywhere.
